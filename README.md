  the final adjustments including merging offensiveStats with defensiveStats, 
  and making final attgribute updates. Also, cleaned up the look and feel to 
  improve visual presentation.
  
  2) Conversion to Logical Design (RA Model) - Created the PDF which show the
  original ER Model and how it was normalized and converted into an RA model.
  
  3) Scripts - Made all scripts that populate all tables withing the database
  including teams, games, players and seasonStats.
  
  4) Integration Testing - Created SQL scripts to run queries on the created
  database to test functionality. All tests produced expected results.

  Provided input to further help clarify and hone the entities and entity-

  and gamePage.php and was responsible for troubleshooting and fixing bugs
