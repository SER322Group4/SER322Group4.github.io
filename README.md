Baseball Database for the final project.

1: Install Xampp
-- You can use the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdvVKywGlc0) to set up your Xampp the same we set up ours.
-- We used localhost:1234/
-- username = root
-- password = password

(The root by default will not have a password, and this will have to be changed for the MySQL to work correctly).

2: Set up
-- make your database 'Baseball'
-- import the (4) SQL databases in the SQL folder
-- add the PHP/HTML files to the Xampp/htdocs folder

3: In a browser go to localhost:1234/mainscreen.php and you will be able to run through the database.
